The constructor is not performing proper null-check validation on its parameters before proceeding with object initialization.\n\n**Specific Issue:**\nThe constructor should validate both parameters and throw `NullPointerException` when either:\n- The `Checksum` parameter is null\n- The `InputStream` parameter is null\n\nHowever, based on the test failures, the constructor is accepting null values without throwing the expected exceptions, suggesting that either:\n1. **No null checks are implemented** in the constructor\n2. **Null checks are incomplete** (only checking one parameter but not both)\n3. **Exception handling is incorrect** (throwing a different exception type or no exception at all)\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe production code constructor is likely proceeding with object creation even when critical dependencies (Checksum and InputStream) are null, which violates the contract expected by these tests and represents a defensive programming failure.\n\nThis defect would cause all three tests to fail consistently since none of the null parameter scenarios are being properly validated.",

            "reason": "#10# This method is definitely the best location to be fixed because all three test failures are directly related to the constructor's failure to validate null parameters. The constructor code shows no null checks on either the Checksum or InputStream parameters, which explains why all tests expecting NullPointerException are failing. The constructor simply assigns the parameters to instance variables without any validation, allowing null values to be accepted silently."
