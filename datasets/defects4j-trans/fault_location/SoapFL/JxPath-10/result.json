The other comparison operators appear to be working correctly since the test only fails at the `>=` assertion.\n\nThis suggests the issue is not with the general handling of empty node sets, but specifically with how the `>=` comparison operation is implemented when one operand is an empty node set.\n\n## Step 3: Recommended Production Code Defect\n\nBased on my analysis, I recommend investigating the following possible defect in the production code:\n\n**The CoreOperationGreaterThanOrEqual class (or equivalent implementation) is incorrectly handling empty node set comparisons by returning `true` instead of `false` when comparing an empty node set with a numeric value.**\n\n**Specific areas to examine:**\n1. The `CoreOperationGreaterThanOrEqual.compute()` method or equivalent comparison logic\n2. The node set evaluation logic in comparison operations, particularly for `>=`\n3. The empty node set detection and handling mechanism in comparison operations\n4. The type coercion logic when comparing node sets with numeric values\n\nThe defect likely lies in how the production code determines the result when the left operand (node set) is empty. According to XPath semantics, any comparison with an empty node set should return `false`, but the `>=` operation is incorrectly returning `true`.\n\nThis appears to be an isolated issue with the `>=` operator implementation rather than a general problem with empty node set handling, since the other comparison operators in the same test are passing.",
